// recent repos in most-recently-used order, then repos found by scanning
// Worktree.SearchPaths (opt-in — empty by default, so scanning contributes
// nothing until a user configures it), then zoxide's tracked directories when
// zoxide is installed. Every candidate is canonicalized before deduping
// (config.CanonicalRepoPath — the same contract every source must use) so the
