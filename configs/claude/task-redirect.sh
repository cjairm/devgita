# PreToolUse hook: intercept a narrow set of raw-git command patterns that have
# a dedicated `devgita task` equivalent, and deny with the exact replacement to
# run instead. See docs/apps/claude.md ("Command redirect (PreToolUse hook)")
# for the full contract.
#
# Claude Code delivers the hook payload as JSON on stdin; for a PreToolUse hook
# on the Bash tool, the command string lives at `.tool_input.command` (verified
# against Claude Code's current hook docs, code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks). To
# deny, this script exits 2 and writes a one-line reason to stderr — Claude
# Code blocks the call and shows the agent that stderr text. This is the
# simpler, exit-code-based deny mechanism (vs. printing structured
# hookSpecificOutput/permissionDecision JSON to stdout): it has no JSON-
# escaping failure mode that could silently fail open or closed, which matters
# more here than for format.sh's PostToolUse hook (which only ever surfaces
# advisory context, never blocks). Any other outcome — no command field, an
# unmatched command, jq missing — falls through to exit 0 (allow): this hook
# must never accidentally block all Bash calls.
#
# Escape hatch: set DEVGITA_SKIP_TASK_REDIRECT=1 for the session to bypass this
# hook entirely when raw git is genuinely needed. Every deny message repeats
# this so no flow dead-ends.
#
# NB: the command string is only ever pattern-matched (grep), never eval'd or
# executed — no command-injection surface from the JSON payload.
#
# Keep this file's pattern table and configs/opencode/plugin/task-redirect.js's
# pattern table in sync — they intentionally mirror each other one-for-one.
#
# Rule scope (these hooks deploy to the user's GLOBAL config, so they fire in
# EVERY repo):
#   - Global rules fire everywhere: review-package (git diff/log <ref>..<ref>),
#     worktree-start (git worktree add), worktree-finish (git worktree remove),
#     and the gh redirects pr-checks / review-threads / submit-review. These
#     impose no repo-specific convention — they're better/compressed forms of
#     universal git/gh operations.
#   - The two release rules (git reset --soft HEAD~N, git tag -a v<semver>) are
#     devgita-repo-only: they encode devgita's own release policy and would be
#     wrong to steer in other repos. They fire only when is_devgita_repo
#     confirms a go.mod with module github.com/cjairm/devgita, and fail toward
#     NOT firing on any uncertainty (see is_devgita_repo).
#
# Matching scope (read before touching the patterns below):
#   - Each rule is checked against every "command segment" of the input, not
#     just the start of the whole string. Segments are split on unquoted &&,
#     ||, ;, and | so that `cd x && git worktree add y`, `git status; git
#     worktree remove y`, and `git fetch && git diff a..b` are all caught —
#     not just a bare `git ...` with nothing else on the line.
#   - Each rule's `git` anchor also tolerates a leading run of shell
#     VAR=value assignments (e.g. `GIT_PAGER=cat git diff a..b`), so an
#     env-var prefix with NO separator character before `git` is caught too.
#   - Splitting respects single- and double-quoted spans (a `;` or `&&`
#     inside a quoted commit message is not treated as a boundary), but this
#     is a best-effort, non-adversarial split: it does not handle
#     backslash-escaped quotes, command substitution ($(...) / `...`), or
#     heredocs. A command deliberately crafted to defeat quote tracking is
#     out of scope — this hook pattern-matches agent-typed commands, it is
#     not a shell parser.

# Bypass first, before touching stdin, so it works even if stdin is malformed.

# is_devgita_repo answers "is the command running inside the devgita repo?" —

# It walks UP from the payload's working dir (CWD, falling back to $PWD)
# looking for the FIRST go.mod; the repo IS devgita only if that go.mod's
# module path is exactly github.com/cjairm/devgita. It memoizes its result so
# multiple release segments/rules in one invocation check at most once.
#
# CRITICAL: this fails TOWARD NOT firing. If the working dir is indeterminate,
# no go.mod is found, or the module doesn't match, it returns non-zero (repo is
# NOT devgita) — so the raw git command is allowed through rather than a
# general reset/tag being wrongly blocked outside devgita. It is only ever
# called AFTER a release pattern has already matched, so the common allow path
# never pays the go.mod-lookup cost.
