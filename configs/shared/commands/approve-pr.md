Confirm that the feedback on an already-reviewed PR was actually addressed, then approve it — or report what still blocks the merge.

## Usage

```
/approve-pr [PR_NUMBER]
```

The PR is resolved from the current branch unless you pass a number. The repo is the current working directory.

This is the **deciding-approver** step, not a review — the full review lives in `/review-pr`. Because concerns were already raised, read the threads first to confirm they were genuinely resolved before you put your name on the merge.

## Process

### 1. Find the PR

If a `PR_NUMBER` was given, use it (pass `--pr PR_NUMBER` below). Otherwise:

```bash
devgita task current-pr
```

If it prints "No pull request found for the current branch.", stop and tell the user this branch has no PR. Do nothing else.

### 2. Confirm it's reviewable

```bash
devgita task pr-view          # add --pr PR_NUMBER if you have one
```

Confirm the state is open. The `review:` line shows whether it already carries reviews — if it has none, say so and recommend `/review-pr` first rather than approving cold.

### 3. Check the gates

Read the unresolved threads — these are the blockers:

```bash
devgita task review-threads --state unresolved
```

"No unresolved review threads." means everything raised was at least marked resolved.

Then confirm the resolved ones were actually fixed, not just replied to and forgotten:

```bash
devgita task review-threads --state resolved
```

Skim these; only open a file to verify when a resolution looks doubtful. Trust GitHub's resolution state as the primary signal — don't re-litigate the whole diff.

Finally, look at CI — but treat it as a signal, not a gate:

```bash
devgita task pr-checks
```

A failing or errored check is often flaky, an unrelated job, or otherwise still valid, so it does **not** by itself block approval. Flag it in the report so the user can judge; don't let it decide.

### 4. Decide

**Write plainly.** Anything posted to the PR — the approval body or a comment — must be understandable by any engineer, including a junior one: everyday words, short sentences, no fancy vocabulary or filler.

**Approve when both gates hold:** the PR is open and there are no unresolved threads (and any resolved one you spot-checked holds up). Failing checks are noted, not blocking.

```bash
devgita task approve-pr --body "<body picked below>"
```

**The body must match what actually happened on this PR — never thank the author for addressing feedback that was never given.** Pick by situation:

| Situation                                                       | Body                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No feedback was ever raised (no threads, no prior review notes) | `LGTM.` — plain, nothing more                                                                   |
| Feedback was raised and addressed                               | `LGTM. Thanks for working on the suggestions 🔥` — vary the phrasing, keep it one line          |
| Approving while flagging something non-blocking                 | `LGWC; <one short clause naming it>` — comments worth addressing before merge, but not blockers |

Don't paste the gate summary or per-thread detail into the PR — that belongs in the report to the user, not the review. If checks are red, mention it in one short clause (e.g. "LGTM — CI has a failing job worth a look") rather than withholding approval.

**If a real gate blocks** (an unresolved thread, or a resolution that doesn't hold up), do **not** approve. Report it to the user; the author can clear it with `/address-feedback`. If a note on the PR is warranted, post one terse comment — not a per-thread recap:

```bash
devgita task comment-pr --body "<one short line naming what's left>"
```

## Output

Return only this terse summary to the user — keep it out of the PR itself:

```
## PR #<num> — <approved | not approved>

- threads: <all resolved | N unresolved>
- checks: <passing | N failing (flagged, non-blocking)>
- reviews: <present | none>

<if not approved: a short bullet per blocker>
```

## Notes

- This command never edits code and never runs a full review — that's `/review-pr`.
- Never approve with unresolved threads. Failing CI is flagged, not a blocker — the user decides what to do about it.
- Both the approval and any comment stay terse; the detail goes to the user, not the PR.
