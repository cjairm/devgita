# CLAUDE.md — Devgita Development Guide

⚠️ **DOCUMENTATION CURRENCY:** This file is the source of truth for development practices. Keep it up to date as patterns and decisions evolve. Stale documentation is worse than no documentation—it misleads contributors. If you change how we do something, update this file and/or linked files in the same PR.

## 1. What this is

Devgita is a cross-platform development environment manager that automates installation and configuration of terminal tools, programming language runtimes, database systems, and desktop applications on macOS and Debian/Ubuntu.

**Core functionality:**

- **Installation automation** — `dg install` with interactive category selection
- **Category-based setup** — terminal tools, languages, databases, desktop apps
- **Cross-platform support** — Single command syntax works on macOS and Linux
- **Smart state tracking** — `global_config.yaml` tracks what was installed by devgita
- **Configuration templates** — Embedded configs applied consistently across machines
- **Idempotent operations** — Safe to re-run; detects existing packages

For planned features and roadmap, see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)

## 3. Product principles

1. **Zero-dependency installer** — Installation happens via shell script alone; no pre-installed tools required beyond bash/curl
2. **Idempotent operations** — Running `dg install` twice produces the same result; safe to re-run
3. **Cross-platform consistency** — Same command syntax and behavior on macOS and Linux; platform differences are transparent to users
4. **Configuration persistence** — User edits to configs are never overwritten; new installs preserve existing customizations
5. **Modular architecture** — Each app is independent; failures in one app don't cascade to others
6. **Transparent state** — All installation state tracked in `~/.config/devgita/global_config.yaml`; users can inspect what was installed
7. **Visual consistency** — Alacritty, tmux, Neovim, and the AI-coder configs share one palette (Gruvbox dark) and a transparency convention; a color/theme change in one must be mirrored in the others. See [docs/guides/theming.md](docs/guides/theming.md)

## 4. Non-negotiable rules

Hard constraints that override all other considerations:

### Engineering Discipline

- Fix root causes, never symptoms. When something misbehaves, find the underlying cause and fix it so the problem cannot recur — a fix that only hides or defers the failure is not done.
- Temporary fixes, workarounds, and hacks are not acceptable. If a proper fix is genuinely impossible right now, say so explicitly and get agreement on the gap before shipping anything less; never ship it silently.
- Where a class of mistake keeps being possible, prefer making it structurally impossible (enforced by code) over documenting a convention people must remember.

### Security

- Never execute arbitrary downloaded code without verification
- All shell scripts (`install.sh`, embedded configs) must be reviewed before execution
- Credentials and secrets must never be stored in configs or committed to git
- User input must always be validated before use (especially paths, command arguments)

### Data Integrity

- Installation state must be atomic: either complete or fully roll back (no partial installations)
- Tests must never read or write real user directories. Under `go test`, `pkg/paths` automatically redirects HOME and all XDG roots into a throwaway sandbox so this cannot happen even when a test forgets to isolate; that guard must never be weakened or bypassed
- User home directory must never be assumed writable in global locations; respect XDG Base Directory if needed
- Config files installed by devgita must be distinguishable from user edits (version markers, checksums)

### Platform Support

- macOS 13+ (Ventura or newer) must be supported; don't use features that break on older versions
- Debian 12+ (Bookworm) and Ubuntu 24+ must be supported; test on both
- Only amd64 and arm64 architectures; drop support only with major version bump

## 6. Implementation behavior

### Coding standards

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) conventions
- **Reuse before writing (DRY):** Before adding any function, helper, or logic, search the codebase for something that already does the job and build on it — extend or delegate rather than re-implement. When a change would make two code paths share the same logic, extract that logic into one place instead of copying it; do the extraction in the same PR that introduces the second use. Duplication found during review is a defect to fix, not a style preference.
- **Prefer existing over new:** When new code is unavoidable, prefer in this order: this codebase's existing helpers and patterns, then the Go standard library, then a dependency the project already uses, and only then new custom code. Never add a new dependency for something the standard library or an existing dependency covers; introducing one is a decision to surface in the PR, not a default. Also question whether the code needs to exist at all — speculative or "for later" code is not written until something needs it. Simplicity never overrides the non-negotiable rules (section 4), correctness, or error handling.
- Naming: camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for exports
- Run `go fmt` before committing (make lint does this)
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT (code should be self-documenting)
- Never ignore errors; always handle or return them explicitly

### Communication style

Applies to every reply the agent writes in this repo — answers, summaries, PR text, commit messages:

- Answer straight and keep it short. Lead with the answer or outcome, then only the detail that changes what the reader does next.
- Brevity comes from cutting filler, never substance. Do not omit important information, caveats, or failures to make a reply shorter.
- Plain language, no fancy wording. Any engineer on the team — regardless of seniority or context — should be able to read a reply once and understand it. Spell out terms instead of assuming shared shorthand.
- No decoration for its own sake: headers, tables, and bullet lists only when they genuinely make the answer easier to scan.
- State uncertainty and problems plainly instead of softening or padding them.

### Lint issues

**Fix lint issues — never suppress them with `//nolint` comments.**

`//nolint` bypasses the linter without addressing the problem; it is never acceptable.

| Issue                                              | Correct fix                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unchecked error (`errcheck`)                       | Handle the error: `if err := f(); err != nil { ... }`. Use `_ = f()` only when the error is genuinely non-actionable (e.g. closing a read-only file) and add a comment explaining why. |
| Empty branch (`SA9003`)                            | Replace the empty `if err != nil {}` with `_ = call()` and a comment if the ignore is intentional.                                                                                     |
| De Morgan's law (`QF1001`)                         | Rewrite: `!(a && b)` → `!a \|\| !b`.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Unchecked `defer` cleanup in tests                 | Use `t.Cleanup(func() { if err := os.RemoveAll(...); err != nil { t.Logf(...) } })` instead of a bare `defer`.                                                                         |
| Cross-file "undefined" from the per-file lint hook | These are false positives — the hook lints a single file and cannot see other files in the same package. Verify with `go build ./...`; if it passes, the issue is not real.            |

### Logger usage

- Initialize once at startup: `logger.Init(verbose)` in cmd/root.go
- Use logger for all output, not println/fmt.Print
- Log levels: error (always), warn (important), info (user actions), debug (detailed)

### Error handling

**See [docs/guides/error-handling.md](docs/guides/error-handling.md) for detailed patterns.**

Key principles:

- Always check errors: `if err != nil { return err }` or `logger.Fatal(err)`
- Use `MaybeExitWithError()` for user-facing errors
- Provide actionable error messages: tell users what went wrong and how to fix it
- Never expose raw Go errors to users; wrap and clarify

### Feature workflow (implement → verify → test → commit)

Follow this order for every non-trivial change:

1. **Implement** the feature or fix.
2. **Verify manually** that it works end-to-end (run the binary, use the UI, confirm the golden path).
3. **Add or update tests** — only after the feature is confirmed working. Tests written against a broken feature encode the wrong behavior.
4. **Commit** once both manual verification and `go test ./...` pass.

> Before committing, always ask: _"Does this change have tests? Should it?"_ If the answer is yes and tests are missing, write them first. A working feature without tests is a regression waiting to happen.

### Testing requirements

**CRITICAL: Always use mocks. Never execute real commands in tests.**

**See [docs/guides/testing-patterns.md](docs/guides/testing-patterns.md) for complete patterns, examples, and reference.**

Accidental real command execution is a common mistake. It can:

- Break tests on different systems (missing tools, platform differences)
- Modify user state (install packages, create files)
- Cause CI failures in shared environments
- Hide bugs (tests pass only if side effects succeed)

**Common mock-safety traps to avoid:**

- Using `foo.New()` in a test that calls state-changing methods — always use `&foo.Foo{Cmd: mockApp.Cmd, Base: mockApp.Base}` instead.
- Calling `testutil.VerifyNoRealCommands(t, tc.MockApp.Base)` after creating a separate `app := foo.New()` — the check targets the wrong base and silently passes even when real commands run.
- Not setting `t.Setenv("TMUX", "")` (or similar env vars) in tests that don't intend to exercise an env-triggered path.

**Testing checklist** (full patterns and examples → [docs/guides/testing-patterns.md](docs/guides/testing-patterns.md)):

- [ ] All public functionality has tests
- [ ] Use `testutil.MockApp` for command mocking — never call `foo.New()` in a test that invokes state-changing methods
- [ ] Verify no real commands executed: `testutil.VerifyNoRealCommands(t, mockApp.Base)` — confirm it's checking the **same** base the app uses
- [ ] **Isolate every path a test mutates (`testutil.SetupCompleteTest` or explicit `paths.Paths.*` overrides) in any test that calls Uninstall, ForceInstall, ForceConfigure, or SoftConfigure — and isolate ALL the roots the operation touches, not just the obvious one.** The automatic `pkg/paths` test sandbox protects real user data as a last resort, but unisolated tests still leak state into other tests through the shared sandbox
- [ ] **Save and restore every `paths.Paths.*` mutation via `t.Cleanup` — prevents cross-test state leakage**
- [ ] Use `t.Helper()` in test helper functions
- [ ] Test both success and failure paths
- [ ] No real Homebrew/apt calls in tests
- [ ] Initialize logger in test file: `func init() { testutil.InitLogger() }`

### App interface pattern

All apps in `internal/apps/` implement the `App` interface defined in `internal/apps/contract.go`. The full contract, sentinel errors, `AppKind` enum, `baseapp.Reinstall`, and constructor patterns are documented in **[docs/guides/app-interface.md](docs/guides/app-interface.md)**.

Quick reference:

- Every app adds `var _ apps.App = (*X)(nil)` for compile-time enforcement
- `ForceInstall` must use `baseapp.Reinstall(a.Install, a.Uninstall)` — never call `Uninstall` directly without handling `ErrUninstallNotSupported`
- Unsupported ops return sentinel errors (`apps.ErrUninstallNotSupported`, `apps.ErrUpdateNotSupported`, …) — **never free-form strings**
- `Fonts` satisfies `FontInstaller`, not `App` — see the guide for details

```go
// Minimal new app pattern
var _ apps.App = (*MyApp)(nil)

func (a *MyApp) Name() string       { return constants.MyApp }
func (a *MyApp) Kind() apps.AppKind { return apps.KindTerminal }

func (a *MyApp) ForceInstall() error { return baseapp.Reinstall(a.Install, a.Uninstall) }
func (a *MyApp) Uninstall() error    { return fmt.Errorf("%w for myapp", apps.ErrUninstallNotSupported) }
func (a *MyApp) Update() error       { return fmt.Errorf("%w for myapp", apps.ErrUpdateNotSupported) }
```

## 7. Critical surfaces

Verify these before changing code in these areas:

### Installation State Management

- [ ] Global config file is updated atomically (write to temp, then rename)
- [ ] Duplicate installations are prevented (check global_config.yaml before install)
- [ ] Rollback on failure works (test by simulating install failure partway through)
- [ ] Installation state persists across shell restarts

### Cross-platform Installation (macOS ↔ Debian/Ubuntu)

- [ ] Package names translated correctly (check `pkg/constants/package_mappings.go`)
- [ ] Debian strategies handle all cases (apt, PPA, Launchpad, script, git clone)
- [ ] Platform detection works reliably (use `BaseCommandExecutor.IsMac()`)
- [ ] Both platforms produce equivalent results (same tool versions, configs)

### Shell Integration

- [ ] Shell config files (`devgita.zsh`) are sourced correctly
- [ ] Mise activation works after install (test: `eval "$(mise activate zsh)"`)
- [ ] User shell customizations are not overwritten
- [ ] Aliases and functions don't conflict with user's existing setup

---

## 8. Platform scope

**Supported platforms:**

- macOS 13+ (Ventura or newer) with Homebrew
- Debian 12+ (Bookworm) and Ubuntu 24+ with APT
- Architectures: amd64, arm64 (Apple Silicon)

**Supported categories:**

- Terminal tools (40+): shells, editors, utilities, runtime managers
- Languages: Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, PHP (via Mise or native)
- Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite
- Desktop apps: Platform-specific GUIs (Docker, browsers, window managers, etc.)

**Single-command installation:**

- `dg install` — interactive full setup
- `dg install --only <category>` — install specific category
- `dg install --skip <category>` — install all except category

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned features and future platform support

---

## 9. Versioning & tagging

Devgita follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) strictly: **`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`**

### Which bump to use

| Change type                                                                      | Bump              | Example                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Bug fix, typo, test fix, docs correction                                         | **PATCH** `x.x.^` | `v0.10.2` -> `v0.10.3` |
| New feature, new app installer, new command, new flag                            | **MINOR** `x.^.x` | `v0.10.3` -> `v0.11.0` |
| Breaking change to CLI interface, config format change, removed platform support | **MAJOR** `^.x.x` | `v0.11.0` -> `v1.0.0`  |

**Rules:**

- Tags always start with `v` (e.g., `v0.10.3`, not `0.10.3`)
- PATCH resets to 0 on MINOR bump; MINOR and PATCH reset to 0 on MAJOR bump
- Refactoring with no behavior change = PATCH (conservative)
- Multiple bug fixes in one release = single PATCH bump
- A release mixing features and fixes = MINOR bump (the higher bump wins)
- When in doubt, ask before tagging

### Push & tag workflow

When pushing commits and creating a tag, **always squash multiple unpushed commits into one before tagging.** This keeps the git history clean and makes it easy for developers to understand what each tag/release includes.

**Steps:**

1. Check how many commits are ahead of remote: `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`
2. If **2+ unpushed commits** exist:
   - Squash them into a single commit: `git reset --soft HEAD~N && git commit -m "..."`
   - The squashed commit message should **preserve context from all original commits** — copy the bullet points from each commit message into the body. Only summarize if the combined list is too long to be readable.
3. Create an **annotated tag** (`git tag -a`) with the same bullet points in the tag message, so developers can see what the release includes directly from the tag.
4. Push commit and tag together: `git push origin main --tags`

**Example squashed commit + tag:**

```bash
# Squash 3 commits into one
git reset --soft HEAD~3
git commit -m "feat: add user profile and caching

- Add user profile page with avatar upload
- Implement Redis caching layer with 5-min TTL
- Add profile API endpoints with validation"

# Tag with the same context
git tag -a v0.11.0 -m "v0.11.0 — User profile and caching

- Add user profile page with avatar upload
- Implement Redis caching layer with 5-min TTL
- Add profile API endpoints with validation"

git push origin main --tags
```

GitHub Actions builds and publishes automatically. See [docs/guides/releasing.md](docs/guides/releasing.md) for the full release process.

## 10. Change discipline

Things that must never happen silently (always require explicit PR discussion and test):

- Altering command signatures (`dg install --something`) without deprecation plan
- Adding new package categories without updating installer logic and tests
- Changing config file format (`global_config.yaml`) without migration strategy
- Removing support for a platform (macOS or Linux) without major version bump
- Modifying what "terminal tools" category includes — users depend on this being stable
- Changing installation paths or config directories — affects existing installations

---

## 11. Spec-driven development

When to write documentation **before** code:

- **Write a cycle doc** when tackling a feature that spans multiple commands or touches multiple layers (see `docs/plans/TEMPLATE.md`)
- **Write an ADR** when choosing between technologies, patterns, or approaches with lasting impact (see `docs/decisions/TEMPLATE.md`)
- **Skip both** for bug fixes, incremental improvements to existing features, or obvious changes
- **Quick ADR** (one page) for local design decisions; full ADR for platform-level choices

**Required workflow before implementing ANY code changes:**

1. If the change is substantial, create a cycle document in `docs/plans/cycles/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`
2. If the design chose between competing approaches with lasting impact, record each such choice as an ADR in `docs/decisions/` **before implementation starts** — a cycle doc's trade-offs section does not replace an ADR, and a design discussion that ends in an approved choice is not done until the ADR exists
3. Get user/team approval before implementing
4. Track progress by checking off steps as you go
5. When all steps are complete, mark all tasks/checkboxes in the cycle doc as done and update the status field in the document header to **Done**

---

## 11. Architecture Patterns

### Cross-platform installation

See `docs/guides/cross-platform-installation.md` for full details.

**Package Mappings:** `pkg/constants/package_mappings.go`

- Translates Homebrew package names → APT package names (e.g., `gdbm` → `libgdbm-dev`)

**Installation Strategies:** `internal/commands/debian_strategies.go`

- `AptStrategy` — Standard apt install with automatic name translation
- `PPAStrategy` — Personal Package Archives with GPG key configuration
- `LaunchpadPPAStrategy` — Launchpad PPA via `add-apt-repository`
- `InstallScriptStrategy` — Executable install scripts (`curl | sh`)
- `NerdFontStrategy` — GitHub release downloads for fonts
- `GitCloneStrategy` — Git repository cloning and setup

**Strategy pattern flow:**

1. Each app has a `GetInstallStrategy()` method
2. Strategy is platform-aware (returns different strategy on macOS vs. Debian)
3. Strategies handle error cases and retries (exponential backoff for downloads)
4. No knowledge of specific tools in strategy base—fully generic

### Testing pattern

```go
func init() { testutil.InitLogger() }

func TestFeature(t *testing.T) {
    mockApp := testutil.NewMockApp()
    app := &MyApp{Cmd: mockApp.Cmd, Base: mockApp.Base}

    // Test logic here

    // Always verify no real commands executed
    testutil.VerifyNoRealCommands(t, mockApp.Base)
}
```

## 12. Codebase landmarks

Where to find and add code:

| Purpose                   | Location                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Adding a new command

**See [docs/guides/cli-patterns.md](docs/guides/cli-patterns.md) for detailed patterns, examples, and best practices.**

1. Read cli-patterns.md to understand command structure and patterns
2. Create handler in `cmd/{command}.go` (or create subdirectory for complex commands with subcommands)
3. Implement command logic using Cobra following patterns from cli-patterns.md
4. Add tests alongside implementation (`*_test.go`) using [docs/guides/testing-patterns.md](docs/guides/testing-patterns.md)
5. Register in `cmd/root.go`
6. Document in README.md and `docs/spec.md` if user-facing
7. If substantial, create a cycle doc first (see section 10)

### Adding a new app installer

1. Create directory `internal/apps/{appname}/`
2. Implement `{appname}.go` with app interface
3. Implement `{appname}_test.go` with tests
4. Add config templates to `configs/{appname}/` if applicable
5. Register in appropriate category in `internal/tooling/{category}/`
6. Document in `docs/apps/{appname}.md`
